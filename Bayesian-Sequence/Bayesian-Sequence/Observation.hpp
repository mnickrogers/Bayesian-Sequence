/*
 The observation class handles a single observation of data.
 
 It contains an association of an event with a prediction.
 For example, let's say you were predicting the probability the stock market
 rising tomorrow morning. A successful jobs report would be a good
 indicator. The release of the jobs report is the event and the association
 between the jobs report and the prediction (the stock market rising) would
 be the observation.
